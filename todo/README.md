# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and interactive to-do list built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with data saved in the browser using **localStorage**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (with strikethrough effect)
- ✅ Delete individual tasks
- ✅ Store tasks in `localStorage` so they're saved even after refreshing
- ✅ "Clear All" button to remove all tasks at once

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each task is stored as an object with `id`, `text`, `isCompleted`, and `priority`.
- Tasks are rendered dynamically using JavaScript and updated in localStorage.
- Click on the task to toggle completion.
- Click the delete button to remove it.
- Select priority when adding a task — styled with different colors.
- "Clear All" deletes all tasks and resets the list.
